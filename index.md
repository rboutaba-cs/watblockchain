## Project Description

This project focuses on building secure decentralized applications, in particular those around blockchains and related technologies. For instance, an early research outcome was Bitforest, a blockchain-based PKI that allows for centralized name administration and efficient lookups, but enforces security without trusting any authority. Some of the other onoing research works include Elasticoin, a low-volatility cryptocurrency issuance scheme, and Astrape, an anonymous payment channel construction. This project is also exploring the concept of a minimal blockchain that leaves most functionality to upper-layer applications.
