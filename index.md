## Project Description

In this project, we intend to devise efficient and scalable solutions to different practical problems related to embedding virtual networks on elastic optical networks. Advances in these research avenues in collaboration with a major industrial partner will have a lasting impact on the design principles and management paradigms of virtualization in elastic optical networks.
